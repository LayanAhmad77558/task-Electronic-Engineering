alking Algorithm for a Humanoid Robot (6 Servos)

Assumption:
 • 2 Servos for legs (hip movement)
 • 2 Servos for knees
 • 2 Servos for arms (balance or swing)

⸻

Algorithm Steps:
 1. Initialize robot in standing position (all servos at 90°).
 2. Lift left leg by moving left knee servo to 60°, and tilt body slightly right using right arm for balance.
 3. Swing left leg forward (left hip servo to ~120°).
 4. Place left leg down and return knee to 90°.
 5. Shift weight to the left leg.
 6. Lift right leg (right knee to 60°), tilt left arm for balance.
 7. Swing right leg forward (right hip to ~120°).
 8. Place right leg down and return knee to 90°.
 9. Repeat steps 2-8 for continuous walking.
